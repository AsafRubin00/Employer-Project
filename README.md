<h1>Employer Project: Delivering Real Business Insights</h1>
<h3>June 2023</h3>

Grade: 95% (High Distinction)<br><br>
Following the completion of the coursework, the LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator provides an opportunity to work on a real-world data analytics project with an Employer Partner. 

The confidential nature of the project required signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement, which limits the extent of detail that can be shared externally, but the framework of the project and the process undertaken to bring it to completion are outlined below. 
<h2>Context</h2>
A leading UK-based packaging distributor sought help with a real-world problem, requiring an analysis ofÂ  one month's worth of internally-generated data to arrive at a cost-saving solution. Our team was required to perform a feasibility study based on the data provided, and to undertake further research to better understand the industry, competitive landscape, and other environmental considerations. Potential risks, challenges and their mitigation were also considered. 
<h2>Team and project plan</h2>
Our project team comprised of seven members, each with their own clearly-defined responsibilities. Working across five different time zones required us to optimise our communications. We used a combination of GitHub, Google and Discord to collaborate and manage version control effectively. 
<br><br>
As team leader, it was my responsibility to oversee progress, facilitate team communication, manage deadlines and communicate with our stakeholders (the representatives of the client company). Our flexible team dynamic was such that we tackled data wrangling, analysis and visualisations in smaller task teams of 2-3 members. In addition to my responsibilities as team leader, I also contributed to data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualisations. I also took on the responsibility of being the teams' presenter: preparing and presenting the final Tableau story we used to communicate our initial and final presentations.
<h2>Process</h2>
We had 6 weeks in which to complete the project, which was carried out as follows:<br><br>

As a first step, we built a project roadmap: a high-level overview of the project's phases, milestones and deliverables. We also built a Gantt chart, based on our project roadmap to help maintain an agile project management approach. Our analytical approach was as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Phase I</b> (<i>weeks 1 - 2</i>): Data Collection and Cleaning: Gathered the relevant data from the client company and cleaned and preprocessed the data using Excel and Python's Pandas library to ensure accuracy and consistency.</li>
<li><b>Phase II </b>(<i>weeks 2 - 3</i>): Data Exploration and Feature Engineering : Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned data to identify key trends and patterns for further analysis.</li>
<li><b>Phase III</b> (<i>weeks 3 - 4</i>): Analytical Model Development: Building on the results of the EDA, we built an optimization model using linear programming, to assess the efficiency of our solution. We built a Tablueau story to succinctly communicate our findings and recommendations. </li>
<li><b>Phase IV</b> (<i>weeks 5 - 6</i>): Analysis of Results and Recommendations: Interpreted the model results and offered recommendations to the client company. We prepared a detailed report and presentation which was used to communicate our findings and suggestions to the client's management team. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Client Feedback</h2>

"The team took on board our feedback and balanced their final presentation, which was professional and polished. We enjoyed the way the team framed the business question, presented the three different scenarios across the different clusters, and clearly explained the constraints and assumptions of their modelling. Excellent proposed implementation that is both practical and feasible. You have provided a solid analysis with an actionable implementation plan, well done. You have certainly made our jobs easier!"
